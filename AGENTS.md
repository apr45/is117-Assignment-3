# AGENTS.md: Portfolio Strategy & Execution

## 1. The Mandate
**Target Career Outcome:** To secure a specialized Game Development or UI/UX internship and establish a reputation at NJIT as a "Technical Developer and Designer. The portfolio must bridge the gap between entry-level programming (Java/Python) and digital design (Unity/Procreate), positioning the candidate as a high-value collaborator for student-led startups or advanced IT course projects.

## 2. The Tech Stack
| Tool | Purpose | "Why" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vite** | Build Tool | Provides a lightning-fast development environment and optimized static builds for GitHub Pages. |
| **GitHub Pages** | Hosting | Zero-cost, industry-standard hosting that proves version control proficiency to NJIT recruiters. |
| **Markdown (MD)** | Content Management | Allows for rapid "Devlog" updates and project documentation without refactoring HTML. |
| **HTML5 / CSS3** | Core Structure | Ensures a lightweight, high-performance site that loads instantly from an email signature link. |
