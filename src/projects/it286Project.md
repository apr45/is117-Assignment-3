# Project Alpha: Medieval Tower Defense x FPS Hybrid

## Overview
[cite_start]This project is a sandbox tower defense game featuring medieval themes, developed as a collaborative effort for **IT286** at NJIT. [cite_start]Players act as a Kingdom Commander, strategically placing military forces to protect the castle from waves of enemies.

## Core Systems
* [cite_start]**Hybrid Perspective:** Players can remain in an omniscient commander view to regulate towers or switch directly into a troop's perspective for 1-to-many combat.
* [cite_start]**Economy & Strategy:** Access to various towers and power-ups is managed through a currency system tied to enemy kills.
* [cite_start]**Win/Loss Conditions:** If enemies breach the castle and health reaches zero, the game ends.

## Technical Contributions (My Role)
As a Developer and Designer on this team, I am responsible for the following architectural and visual elements:

### 1. Level Design & Difficulty Scaling
* [cite_start]**Three-Difficulty Framework:** Designing three distinct maps categorized by difficulty.
* [cite_start]**Unity Tilemaps:** Utilizing Unity’s Tilemap system to construct environment layouts that balance tower placement strategy with FPS combat arenas.

### 2. UI/UX & Menu Systems
* [cite_start]**Menu Architecture:** Developing the core menu system to ensure seamless navigation between gameplay and settings.
* [cite_start]**Icon Design:** Creating custom icons in Photoshop to represent different units, towers, and power-ups in the player's HUD.
* [cite_start]**Unity UI:** Implementing these assets within Unity's UI system to provide clear feedback on currency and castle health.

## Current Development Status
[cite_start]This project is currently in the **prototype phase**. [cite_start]We are focused on refining the transition between the commander and troop perspectives while polishing the tilemap layouts for the initial three difficulty levels.
