## Project Overview
This portfolio serves as a professional anchor for my work at NJIT, specifically designed to bridge the gap between entry-level programming (Java/Python) and technical game design (Unity/Procreate). The site acts as an authority engine to facilitate collaboration with NJIT staff and students on video game projects and personal ventures.

## The Orchestration Log
When I first began working on the `AGENTS.md`, the AI would make certain assumptions about the file structure, sitemap, or technical tools that did not fit my vision. I realized that the AI was limited to the answers I had provided for the questions it generated, so I decided to provide more details about my goals for the site and address the aspects of its initial suggestions with which I disagreed.
